	<h3>HTTP Error 501 server error</h3>
      <p>The server either does not recognize the request method, or it
		lacks the ability to fulfill the request.</p>

	<p>Why it occurs</p>

	<p>The error occurs when the Web server does not understand or does
		not support the HTTP method it finds in the HTTP data stream sent to
		it by the client. The method in the request HTTP data stream should be
		one of the following GET, OPTIONS, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and
		CONNECT as defined by the HTTP protocol Or the method may be valid but
		not actually supported by the Web server.</p>
	<p>Fixing 501 error code</p>
	<p>The client should specify a valid request type. Even after that
		if the Web server is responding incorrectly, then the web server
		simply needs to be upgraded to fix the issue. If you are registered
		with 100pulse, your site will be monitored and you will be intimated
		by an email or a short message service when 501 status code error
		occurs.</p>
