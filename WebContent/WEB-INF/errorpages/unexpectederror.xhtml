		<h3>HTTP Error 500 Internal server error</h3>
		<br />
		<h4 align="left">Introduction</h4>
		<p align="left">The Web server (running the Web Site) encountered an unexpected
			condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request by the client
			(e.g. your Web browser or our CheckUpDown robot) for access to the
			requested URL.</p>

		<p align="left">This is a 'catch-all' error generated by the Web server.
			Basically something has gone wrong, but the server can not be more
			specific about the error condition in its response to the client. In
			addition to the 500 error notified back to the client, the Web server
			should generate some kind of internal error log which gives more
			details of what went wrong. It is up to the operators of the Web
			server site to locate and analyse these logs.</p>

		<h4 align="left">500 errors in the HTTP cycle</h4>
		<p align="left">Any client (e.g. your Web browser or our CheckUpDown robot)
			goes through the following cycle when it communicates with the Web
			server: Obtain an IP address from the IP name of the site (the site
			URL without the leading 'http://'). This lookup (conversion of IP
			name to IP address) is provided by domain name servers (DNSs). Open
			an IP socket connection to that IP address. Write an HTTP data stream
			through that socket. Receive an HTTP data stream back from the Web
			server in response. This data stream contains status codes whose
			values are determined by the HTTP protocol. Parse this data stream
			for status codes and other useful information. This error occurs in
			the final step above when the client receives an HTTP status code
			that it recognizes as '500'. (Last updated: March 2012).</p>

		<h4 align="left">Fixing 500 errors - general</h4>

		<p align="left">This error can only be resolved by fixes to the Web server
			software. It is not a client-side problem. It is up to the operators
			of the Web server site to locate and analyse the logs which should
			give further information about the error.</p>

		<h4 align="left">Fixing 500 errors - CheckUpDown</h4>

		<p align="left">Please contact us (email preferred) whenever you encounter 500
			errors on your CheckUpDown account. We then have to liaise with your
			ISP and the vendor of the Web server software so they can trace the
			exact reason for the error. Correcting the error may require recoding
			program logic for the Web server software, which could take some
			time.</p>
